  <p> Factories spew greenhouse gases into the air, contributing to the thickening of the ozone layer. This prevents heat from the sun and ends up turning the Earth into a convection oven that gets hotter as more CO2 spews into the air.</p>

  <p>Because of the heating Earth, water evaporates quicker and causes droughts. In other places however, the same affects may cause floods instead.</p>
